# Manual Calculation of Deep Learning

Manual calculation in Deep Learning typically involves performing mathematical operations by hand to understand and demonstrate how neural network models work at a fundamental level. This process includes computations related to feedforward and backpropagation steps, such as matrix multiplications, activation functions, and gradient updates. It's a valuable learning exercise for gaining a deep understanding of neural networks and their training processes.
