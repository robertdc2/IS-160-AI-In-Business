# Big City Taxi Fare DL Model 

The Big City Taxi Fare Deep Learning (DL) Model is designed to predict taxi fares in a bustling urban environment. It utilizes a neural network to analyze factors such as distance, time of day, traffic conditions, and other parameters to accurately estimate taxi ride costs. This model is a practical application of DL in the transportation sector, aimed at providing both commuters and taxi services with reliable fare estimates, optimizing pricing strategies, and enhancing the overall transportation experience in a big city.

Assessment of the Output:

The coding work for the Big City Taxi Fare DL Model serves as an excellent demonstration of applying deep learning to real-world challenges. The choice of using a neural network, with different sets of values, parameters, or functions in each version, allows us to explore various approaches to solving the problem. This diversity enables us to assess the impact of different configurations on the model's accuracy and robustness, which is a crucial consideration for real-world applications.

In the first version, I attempted to create a set of meaningful input parameters to calculate the passenger count in the dataset. This strategic approach ensures that the model comprehends the problem context thoroughly, resulting in more precise predictions and enhanced model performance..

In the second version, I engaged in an exploration of diverse network architectures and hyperparameters to refine the model's architecture for effectively distinguishing between AM and PM taxi fares. This effort was driven by the objective of identifying the most optimal configuration tailored to the unique requirements of our task.

The third version I incorporated historical data collected over specific years, integrating it into the deep learning model to enhance the accuracy and robustness of fare estimations. This approach leverages the power of deep learning to analyze long-term trends, helping the model make more informed predictions based on historical patterns and fluctuations in taxi fares.

Readers can take away several key insights from these different versions. They will learn the importance of feature engineering in machine learning projects, the significance of choosing the right neural network architecture and hyperparameters, and the role of training optimization techniques in achieving better model performance. This coding work is a valuable resource for those interested in applying deep learning to solve real-world problems, especially in the field of transportation and pricing optimization.
