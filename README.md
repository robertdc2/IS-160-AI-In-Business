# Reinforcement Learning Diagram

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties as it takes actions, allowing it to learn optimal strategies through trial and error. It involves the exploration of actions to maximize cumulative rewards, often using algorithms like Q-learning or policy gradients. Through this process, the agent learns to make better decisions in complex, uncertain environments. Readers exploring reinforcement learning concepts can gain an understanding of how agents learn from experiences to maximize rewards, adapt strategies through trial and error, and navigate challenging decision-making scenarios, offering insights into building AI systems capable of learning from interactions.
